    <h2>Francesinha Recipe - Step by step</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slightly toast the bread – in the oven or in the toaster but without
        smooshing it, so it doesn’t lose its thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the steak medium/rare and allow it to rest away from the heat for a
        few minutes, to retain the juices. Slit it slightly so that it’s easier
        to cut later on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the linguiça and the Italian sausage length wise and trim them, if
        necessary, to match the size of the bread. Cook them in the same pan as
        the steak.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the egg(s) in the same pan again (optional). Fry the potatoes on the
        side (opcional).
      </li>
      <li>
        Assembling: after toasted, place one slice of bread in a deep dish that
        can go in the oven, and lay the slices of ham and baloney over the
        bread; place the sausage and the linguiça interspersed, side by side,
        and then the steak; place the second slice of bread on top and cover it
        all with cheese slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn on the broil and place it in the oven until the cheese has melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven, (place the egg on top), pour at least two ladles
        of sauce over the francesinha and serve immediatly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the rest of the sauce in a gravy boat and serve seperately (as well
        as the fries).
      </li>
    </ol>

      </li>
      <li>

        boil and allow it to stay there while you prepare the next step.
      </li>

        pot.
      </li>

        the alcohol evaporates (with the lid half on).

      <li>
        Add the beers, the Worcestershire sauce, the piripiri sauce and the
        boullion.

        15 minutes, with the lid on.
