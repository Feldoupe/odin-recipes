    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      <em>
        Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish made with eggs,
        cheese, pancetta, and pepper. The hot pasta is tossed with the raw eggs,
        creating a creamy sauce that coats the spaghetti. Pecorino Romano cheese
        is traditionally used, though Parmesan can also be added. The dish is
        simple yet flavorful and is a staple of Roman cuisine.

    <h2>Carbonara Recipe - Step by step</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta cooks, fry the pancetta in a large pan until it becomes
        crispy. Optionally, add the garlic to the pan for additional flavor,
        then remove it after the pancetta is cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, beat the eggs and mix in the grated Pecorino Romano and
        Parmesan cheeses. Add a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the spaghetti, reserving some of the pasta water. Add the spaghetti
        to the pan with the pancetta and mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pan from the heat, and quickly stir in the egg and cheese
        mixture, ensuring that the pasta is well coated. Add a little pasta water
        if needed to create a smooth, creamy sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately, with extra cheese and black pepper if desired.
      </li>
