    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      <em>
        Francesinha is a traditional sandwich from Porto, Portugal, consisting
        of layers of toasted bread and a variety of hot meats, including roast
        beef, steak, cured ham, linguiça, or chipolata. The sandwich is topped
        with melted cheese and covered with a hot, tomato-based beer sauce known
        as molho de francesinha. It is commonly served with french fries on the
        side.

    <h2>Francesinha Recipe - Step by step</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Lightly toast the bread in an oven or toaster, taking care not to press
        it too much so it retains its thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the steak to medium/rare, then let it rest for a few minutes off
        the heat to keep the juices in. Slice it slightly to make it easier to
        cut later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Split the linguiça and sausage lengthwise, trimming them to match the
        size of the bread if needed. Cook them in the same pan used for the
        steak.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the egg(s) in the same pan (optional). Fry the potatoes separately
        (optional).
      </li>
      <li>
        Assembly: Place one slice of toasted bread in a deep oven-safe dish.
        Layer the ham and bologna slices on the bread, then add the sausage,
        linguiça, and steak. Place the second slice of bread on top and cover
        everything with the cheese slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn on the broiler and place the dish in the oven until the cheese is
        melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven, place the egg on top if using, pour at least two
        ladles of sauce over the Francesinha, and serve immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the remaining sauce separately in a gravy boat along with the
        fries.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Sauce recipe - Step by step</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Finely chop the onion and sauté in the olive oil until it becomes soft
        and translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the white wine, ketchup, and tomato paste. Bring to a boil and keep
        it there while preparing the next steps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dissolve the oxtail soup mix in 520 ml of boiling water and add it to
        the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the whiskey and Port wine, and let the mixture boil for about 35
        minutes until the alcohol evaporates, with the lid partially on.
      </li>
      <li>Use an immersion blender to make the sauce smooth.</li>
      <li>
        Add the beer, Worcestershire sauce, piri-piri sauce, and bouillon cube.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dissolve the flour in the milk, add it to the pot, and let it boil for
        15 minutes with the lid on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower the heat to the minimum and keep it warm until serving. Avoid
        opening the pot too often to retain the flavor.
